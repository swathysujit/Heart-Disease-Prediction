Hear Disease Prediction - DataDriven.org Project

Using ML to predict if a patient has a heart disease or not, by studying various health factors

Performed variable selection through box plots and step functions in R
Used the final selected variables for building a classification model

Following are the accuracies on the test, from various models:
Kernel SVM (Sigmoid) -> 84%, other kernels were lower
naiveBayes -> 87%
Decision Trees -> 73%
Random Forest -> 75%

Best classifier was Naive Bayes with an accuracy of ~87%
